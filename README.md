# About the Site

Behold, my personal website! Nothing special yet, but a constant work in progress.

You can access the live version of the site here: violetarrowdev.github.io

At present moment, the site has two main features: the console-esque page flow, where text prints and deletes across the screen depending on the selected page, and the Asciinator, which takes images and turns them into text dynamically (currently limited to images that are 500px in width but dynamic image scaling will be added!).

# To-Do

* ~~Different pages of the site should have their own url path associated with them so they can be accessed directly~~
* Get rid of the annoying linebreak "overflow" on the right hand side for the Asciinator (probably due to whitespace preformatting)
* Image compression/autoscaling should be done automatically on git push or build instead of manually
* Add a way for users to asciinate their own images on the site
* Back/forward buttons can cause glitching when done mid-animation, fix in progress
